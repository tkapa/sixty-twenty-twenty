A dumb tool I've thrown together to easily calculate a basic budget.

I've based this off of the [60/20/20 Rule](https://entourage.com.au/budgeting-rule-the-50-20-30-and-60-20-20-budget/), which has helped me initally become more conscious of my spending, and how much I could be saving if I were to be more diligent about it.
